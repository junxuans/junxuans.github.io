Hi! My name is Junxuan (Helen) Shen, a first-year PhD student at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), where I am privileged to be advised by [Prof. Thodoris Lykouris](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/tlykouris/). I am currently supported by the Hewlett Packard Fellowship from MIT School of Engineering. 

I am broadly interested in designing provable online algorithms with AI-human interactions, with tools from stochastic processes and optimization, and with applications such as content moderation and strategic learning.

Before joining MIT, I graduated from [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) with a B.S. degree in computer science and mathematics, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/), [Guannan Qu](https://www.guannanqu.com/), [Nicolas Christianson](https://nicochristianson.com/), and [Adam Sheffer](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/adamsh), and explored research topics including learning-augmented algorithms, control theory, and extremal combinatorics.
